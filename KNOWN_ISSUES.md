---

## ✅ PREVIOUSLY MARKED INCOMPLETE (NOW VERIFIED)

### 3. Sliders Click-to-Set (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
- **Solution:** Moved click-to-set logic from `input` event handler (which only fires during drag) to a proper `mousedown` event handler
- **What Works:** 
  - Clicking anywhere on slider track jumps to that position
  - Uses 8% threshold to avoid interfering with drag operations
  - Dispatches both `input` and `change` events for complete state updates
  - Snaps to step increments correctly
- **Affected Sliders (All Fixed):**
  - Volume slider (main taskbar)
  - Volume slider (settings)
  - Display scale slider
  - Mouse speed slider
  - Pulse intensity slider
- **Location:** `src/main.ts` lines 5984-6029 (mousedown event listener)

---

### 4. Resolution 15-Second Revert Dialog (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- **What Works:**

## 📝 For Next AI Assistant

See below for complete handoff prompt with all technical details and file locations.

- **Location:** Settings → Mouse & Input
- **Issue:** DPI option shows but cannot be changed from 800
- **Investigation Result:**
  - Code uses `ratbagctl` (libratbag) for DPI control
  - Backend: `getMouseDpiInfo()` and `setMouseDpi()` IPC handlers exist
  - **Problem:** `ratbagd` daemon is NOT running in the VM/test environment
  - The UI correctly shows `disabled` state when `mouseDpiSupported = false`
- **Options:**
  1. **Fix it** - Ensure `ratbagd` is installed and running (`sudo apt install ratbagd`)
  2. **Hide it** - Only show DPI option when hardware supports it
- **Recommendation:** Add a note "Requires gaming mouse with ratbagd" or hide when unsupported
- **Status:** 🟡 WORKS BUT HARDWARE-DEPENDENT
- **Priority:** LOW (only affects gaming mice)

### 5. Duress Password - Does it Work?
- **Location:** Settings → Security → Duress Password
- **Current Description:** "Entering this password at lock screen will open a decoy session"
- **Investigation Result:** ✅ **CODE EXISTS AND IS CONNECTED**
  - Line 17370-17376: `if (this.duressPassword && val === this.duressPassword)` → calls `openDecoySession()`
  - `openDecoySession()` sets `isDecoySession = true`, closes all windows, shows "Decoy Session Active" notification
- **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - But needs testing
- **Note:** The decoy session is UI-only (clears windows). It does NOT:
  - Wipe encryption keys
  - Show fake files
  - Log the duress attempt
- **Future Enhancement:** Could add more "decoy" behavior

---

### 6. Tor Mode Doesn't Work / Wrong Implementation
- **Location:** Settings → Security (or Network)
- **Issues:**
  1. Tor toggle may not actually enable system-wide Tor
  2. Current implementation seems to only control the `tor` service
- **Expected Behavior:** 
  - Should be **SYSTEM-WIDE** Tor routing (all traffic through Tor)
  - NOT just browser Tor (that's what Tor Browser is for)
- **Implementation Options:**
  1. Use `torsocks` wrapper for individual apps
  2. Configure transparent proxy via iptables (complex)
  3. At minimum: show instructions to user on how to configure apps
- **Backend Status:** `systemctl start/stop tor` is implemented - service control works
- **Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL - Service control works, system-wide routing NOT implemented
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (advanced feature)


---

### 7. Missing: Resolution Change Confirmation Dialog (15-second revert)
- **Location:** Settings → Display / Resolution changes
- **Issue:** No confirmation dialog when changing resolution
- **Expected Behavior (like Windows):**
  1. User changes resolution
  2. Dialog appears: "Keep these display settings? Reverting in 15 seconds..."
  3. Countdown timer: 15... 14... 13...
  4. If user clicks "Keep Changes" → apply permanently
  5. If no response OR "Revert" clicked → automatically revert to previous resolution
- **Why Important:** If user selects a resolution their monitor doesn't support, they get a black screen and can't click anything to fix it
- **Status:** 🔴 MISSING FEATURE
- **Priority:** HIGH

---

### 8. USB Device Whitelist (Mock)
- **Location:** Settings → Security → Physical Security
- **Issue:** UI says "(Mock)" - these are placeholder devices
- **Devices Shown:**
  - Divine Mouse (HID) - Allowed
  - Holy Keyboard (HID) - Allowed  
  - Suspicious USB Drive (Storage) - Blocked
- **Question:** Is this actually doing anything or just visual?
- **Status:** ❓ LIKELY MOCK - NEEDS VERIFICATION
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

## 🆕 Additional Bugs Found

### 10. Desktop Right-Click Icon Size Options Don't Work
- **Location:** Right-click on desktop → View → Small/Medium/Large Icons
- **Issue:** Clicking "Medium Icons" or "Large Icons" does nothing
- **Expected Behavior:** Desktop icons should resize based on selection
- **Status:** 🔴 NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### 11. Desktop Icons Can Overlap/Stack
- **Location:** Desktop
- **Issue:** Users can drag desktop icons on top of each other, causing stacking/overlap
- **Expected Behavior:** Icons should snap to a grid and NEVER overlap
- **Implementation:**
  1. When dropping an icon, check if that grid cell is occupied
  2. If occupied, find the nearest empty cell
  3. Prevent placing an icon where another exists
- **Status:** 🔴 MISSING COLLISION DETECTION
- **Priority:** MEDIUM

---

## Next Steps

2. [ ] Fix taskbar autohide/transparency (code exists, check why `this.render()` isn't applying changes)
3. [ ] Fix slider UX (click anywhere to set)
4. [ ] Hide DPI setting when unsupported OR add "requires gaming mouse" note
5. [x] ~~Verify Duress Password implementation~~ - WORKS
6. [ ] Decide: keep Tor as service toggle OR implement torsocks wrapper
7. [ ] Add resolution change confirmation dialog with auto-revert
8. [ ] Remove "Tier 10" text (line 15101 in `main.ts`)
9. [ ] Check USB whitelist mock status
10. [ ] Implement desktop icon size change (Small/Medium/Large)
11. [ ] Add grid collision detection to prevent icon overlap

## 🔧 Investigation Findings (For Next Session)

### What Actually Works (Verified in Code):
- **Duress Password:** ✅ Line 17370-17376 in `main.ts` - `openDecoySession()` clears all windows
- **Tor Service Control:** ✅ `systemctl start/stop tor` via `security:setTorEnabled` IPC
- **Mouse DPI:** ✅ Backend exists (`getMouseDpiInfo`, `setMouseDpi`) - requires `ratbagd` daemon
- **Taskbar Autohide:** Code exists at line 18363-18368 - toggles `this.taskbarAutoHide` and calls `this.render()`

### Code Locations:
| Feature | File | Line |
|---------|------|------|
| "Tier 10" text | `src/main.ts` | 15101 |
| Taskbar autohide toggle | `src/main.ts` | 18363-18368 |
| Taskbar autohide class | `src/main.ts` | 3075 |
| Duress password check | `src/main.ts` | 17370-17376 |
| openDecoySession() | `src/main.ts` | 17258-17263 |
| Mouse DPI refresh | `src/main.ts` | 5350-5373 |
| Resolution setting | `electron/main.cjs` | 5419-5456 |

# TempleOS Remake - Bug Fix Session

I need you to fix multiple bugs in my TempleOS Remake project. Read the file KNOWN_ISSUES.md for full details.

## HIGH PRIORITY FIXES:

### 1. Taskbar Right-Click "Enable Autohide" Does Nothing
- Location: `src/main.ts` line 18363-18368
- The code toggles `this.taskbarAutoHide` and calls `this.render()`
- But the taskbar doesn't actually hide/show
- Check line 3075 where `taskbar-autohide` class is applied
- Debug why the CSS class or behavior isn't working

### 2. Taskbar Right-Click "Enable Transparency" Does Nothing  
- Same area as autohide - find and fix the transparency toggle

### 3. Sliders are Hard to Use (Volume, Settings)
- Clicking on the slider track should immediately set the value to that position
- Currently you have to drag the handle
- Add an `onclick` handler to the slider track elements

### 4. Add 15-Second Resolution Revert Dialog
- When user changes resolution in Settings → Display
- Show a confirmation modal: "Keep these display settings? Reverting in 15..."
- Countdown from 15 to 0
- If user clicks "Keep Changes" → save permanently
- If timer expires OR user clicks "Revert" → revert to previous resolution

## MEDIUM PRIORITY FIXES:

### 5. Remove "Tier 10" Text
- Location: `src/main.ts` line 15101
- Change `Game Launchers (Tier 10)` to just `Game Launchers`

### 6. Desktop Icon Size Options Don't Work
- Right-click desktop → View → Small/Medium/Large Icons
- These options exist but don't change icon size
- Implement actual icon resizing

### 7. Desktop Icons Can Overlap/Stack
- Users can drag icons on top of each other
- Add grid collision detection:
  1. When dropping an icon, check if grid cell is occupied
  2. If occupied, find nearest empty cell
  3. Prevent overlap completely

### 8. USB Device Whitelist Says "(Mock)"
- Settings → Security → Physical Security
- Remove "(Mock)" label or implement real USB whitelisting

## LOW PRIORITY:

### 9. Mouse DPI Stuck at 800
- Only works with `ratbagd` daemon (gaming mice)
- Hide when unsupported OR add note "Requires gaming mouse with libratbag"

### 10. Tor Mode is Service-Only
- Currently just toggles `tor` service via systemctl
- Add instructions for users OR implement `torsocks` wrapper

## WHAT ALREADY WORKS (Don't break):
- Duress Password: ✅ Works - calls `openDecoySession()` at line 17370
- All IPC handlers connected to real Linux commands
- File system, terminal, app launching all work

## Project Structure:
- Frontend: `src/main.ts` (18,000+ lines)
- Backend: `electron/main.cjs` (7,000+ lines)  
- Preload: `electron/preload.cjs`
- Styles: `src/style.css`

Start with HIGH PRIORITY fixes first.
