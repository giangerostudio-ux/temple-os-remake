## Bugs

### 1. Task Manager Settings Missing Process List and Hardware Monitoring
When right clicking on the task bar below right now and you click task manager settings it does not have like in windows all the processes u could close down and pc hardware monitoring like in windows. Research how to implement this easily maybe we can use already made code online instead of making it fully from scratch.

### 2. No Easy Way to Uninstall Apps
An easy way to uninstall apps you downloaded like in windows. Also they should not be able to uninstall the system apps we give them - please make sure they can't uninstall those accidentally through this new interface.

### 5. Desktop Right-Click Options Not Working
Fix all options when right clicking in the desktop they are not working for example big icons small icons etc sort by options don't do anything.

### 6. Context Menu Not Closing After Action
When clicking options with right click context menu like for example settings or open terminal it should close the context menu cause it's blocking ur view with the new window that opened.

### 7. Lock Screen Issues
- When u are in lockscreen the restart and shutdown buttons go off below the screen on the pin tab.
- When you launch ur computer it skips the password or pin even though we have a password enabled it skips through the lockscreen - that should not be happening.
