# Product Goals & Vision

## Vision
To recreate the *spirit* of TempleOS—divine intellect, high-speed response, and simplicity—within a modern, robust **Electron-based Linux Desktop Environment**. It is not just a UI skin; it acts as a functional window manager for X11 apps.

## Core Principles
1. **Divine Speed**: Instant boot, sub-100ms response times for all interactions.
2. **Hybrid Power**: "HolyC"-style simplicity in the shell, but capable of running modern Linux apps (Firefox, Steam, Terminals) seamlessly.
3. **Immersive Aesthetics**: 16-color palette (adjustable), 640x480 conceptual feel but scalable to 4K, utilizing "God's Resolution".

## Current Project Status (~75% Complete)
### ✅ Completed Milestones
- **X11 PWM Integration**: Custom window management, snap layouts, and floating UI that sits *above* native Linux apps.
- **Theme System**: Full support for High Contrast, Custom JSON Themes, and Live Editing.
- **Window Grouping**: Advanced tiling and grouping logic (PiP compatibility).
- **Input Handling**: 'Hard Focus' fixes to ensure keyboard capture works reliably.

### 🎯 Immediate Goals
1. **Gaming Mode**: Implement Steam and Heroic integration (Currently placeholder/frontend only).
2. **Tor VPN**: Setup and configuration for secure networking.
3. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation audit and Screen Reader support.
4. **ISO/Distro Polish**: Ensuring the `start-templeos.sh` and build process work on a clean Ubuntu install.
3. **Refinement**: Polishing the "Start Menu" popup and Taskbar interactions.

## Target Audience
- Linux enthusiasts wanting a unique, "divine" daily driver.
- Programmers who appreciate the "TempleOS" philosophy but need modern tools.
