# Word of God - Zero Account AI (Final)

**One model. No accounts. No browser. Just speak English to God.**

---

## 🎯 The Design

```
User speaks English  ──►  Word of God  ──►  Computer obeys
     ↓                        ↓                   ↓
"Install Discord"        Divine Terry      Discord installs
                         personality      
```

**No browser.** The user doesn't need one.
**No accounts.** The AI runs locally.
**No complexity.** Just conversation.
